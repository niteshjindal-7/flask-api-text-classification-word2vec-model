1,in the part 4 of this module we will talk about recommender system and we will show how collaborative filtering based recommendation system is a form of instance based learning so first of all let me introduce what we mean by a recommender system,1_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
2,many of you have used E-Commerce sites like Amazon Flipkart and other sites and you may have seen recommendation systems working so when you log in to the system the system recommend certain items to you are recommended system requirements looks at the past behaviour of the users and the other data that it has and tries to recommend items to the user so that is formally define a recommender system there are two types of recommender system for recommending Method 1 is item recommendation,2_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
3,,3_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
4,that is based on the past history of this user and other users and may be the type of the content recommender system recommends a list of items to the user which the user is likely to purchase a likely to consume the second type of systems that we often look at are called rating predictions,4_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
5,,5_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
6,the classic example is with movies suppose a user is asked to rate movies the users rate movies lete se in the scale of 1 to 5 and different users give ratings for different movies that the set of total movies is very large and one user may give rating to a number of movies newtonsoft movies now the objective is to protect that given a new movie what rating the user will give to that new movie that is called the rating prediction problem so rating means written on a new movie so protect both of these are used to decide whether a person will hire a movie by a book reader book what new stories in find attractive recommend friends at 17 recommendation distance LLB quitters in many E-Commerce almost all E-Commerce systems have recommendation with them now you are familiar with search in search the user is actively looking for something user gives a query and the system returns results so user is trying to pull some information from the system on the other hand recommendation is a system where the system processor items to the user based on users history and may be based on the user's context of formerly we can define the recommendation problem as follows,6_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
7,set of users who so you is the set of users,7_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
8,we have items,8_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav

21,to eat,21_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
22,recommendation problem now there are two broad types of recommendation systems content based recommendation systems and collaborative clustering based recommendation system in content based recommendation system,22_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
23,encounter a recommendation system the rating protection or recommendation is based on the content of the current item and the content of the previous items that the user recommended online site so based on the similarity of the content of those items that the user light and those that is discarded we can try to predict whether the new item will be liked by the user or what rating the user will give to the new items in this is based on content similar,23_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
24,for example,24_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
25,if you are trying to project movies thank you recommend movies to user look at the users look at the movies the user light in the past find out certain features about the movies what was the journal was the director with the authors who are the actors are location at certain important features of those movies and try to find out what features the use of Ions attractive and based on that you try to protect which movie is the user will like the second type of recommendation systems are called collaborative filtering bass,25_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
26,filtering based system the users in order to predict movies for a user will look at the w similar users liked so for a user find similar user,26_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
27,based on past data we look at users who was similar to the current user that is if you know which movies this user like then which movie is the other uses slide find out the similar users and if those similar users or some of the Samurai users have given a rating for this movie use those ratings to predict the rating of the current user they are called collaborative filtering based method and as we see that this involves finding similar users which is what we do it in ke nearest neighbour or instance based learning in collaborative filtering represent each user so so we first constructed a data in our data what we have is that we have,27_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
28,suppose we have a matrix where the different items S1 S2 S3 S4 as a result the columns you want you to you M these are the different users and for a particular user may have rated some movie suppose this movie is rated as 5 this is not rated this is not rated this is rated as to this is rated as 3 for user to maybe this movie is rated as three this movie has to this is not rated not rated this is rated as 4 similarly we have for different users,28_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
29,presented with the movies and they have rated some of the movies and they have not rated some of the movies and what we want to do is that given a user-item pair consisting of a movie with the user has not write a try to predict that for example let's say you 3 is another user who has rated 224,29_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
30,if we consider that you 3 is a similar user to you to and you 304 for this movie that will help you to decide what rating you to will give this movie this is the essence of collaborative filtering now collaborative filtering there are two types of collaborative filtering methods one is based on user based nearest,30_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
31,daj in collaborative filtering nearest neighbour based methods are used and used to decide who are the similar users So In user based nearest neighbour given a user find some users use the ratings of the test item for that those similar users to predict the rating of the test item for the new,31_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
32,there is also a item based nearest neighbour,32_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
33,in item best methods the different items are compared for similarity between up items were obtained by looking at who are the uses vibrated how how to use are separated for the items in the two items which most you which users have rated in a similar way then those items are considered to be similar this is an alternative to content based similarity of items we can use this Matrix we can compare the column vectors to find out the pairwise item similarity and we can use it for recommendation in this way for a user will look at those items the user has recommended user has liked and find out items which are similar to those items so for this item based collaborative filtering which uses item nearestneighbors can be used,33_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
34,for Saksham how to do we have to take two phases to these albums to look at this slide first of all we have to find the neighborhood letters look at user based nearest neighbour In user based nearest neighbour given a user and an item the first look at the user and we find the similar uses so this is the first phase of the algorithm which is called the neighborhood formation face suppose the record of the target user is you can get user you is is represented by a vector and b vector is the rating that user gave to the items for which he has given the rating to the user is a presented by this vector and we find the similarity between the target user you and another potential neighbour V by using some similarity measure a popular similarity measure is the pearson's correlation coefficients pearson's correlation Coefficient can be used to find the similarity between two vectors you and be as the numerator we have summation,34_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
35,all items rating of you for item I - are you bar is the average rating of the user for item X RBI rating of user we for item by us are wiebe average rating of the user we now why do we have Ayub r&r Bieber's here now different users have different standards for dating there are some users who are reluctant to give a 5 if the user like some of you very much we can give a 3 or at most of 4 and not a 5 and there are some users who are very liberal with writing so they may give a rating of 520 movie that he likes so because users have different standards in rating movies we want to somehow normalise them by looking at whether the rating of the movie is above his how much it is more than the his average rating so that is why in this formula we use Sigma are you I - are you bar X RBI time - ARY but are you why is the rating of user you for item and we some it over all it in the denominator we have root over summation over items are you a - are you but whole square x RBI - are we behold the source for normalisation and this is one similarity measure for this type of similarity measure is used to score the similarity between two users U and V after the similarity of youth with all the users has been computed we find the ke nearest neighbours at the stay most similar users according to this,35_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
36,and the second phase is the recommendation face so in the neighborhood formation phase we find the similar users and in the recommendation face we use the rating of those winner users on the test item to recommend the item to the user sofa on the recommendation phase we use the following formula to compute the rating prediction of item I for target user you soti UAE is the predicted rating of user you for item it is equal to are you are you but again is the average rating of that user we want to predict whether it will be below average or above average and how much it will exceed or be different from the average and this is computed as Singh we included in v v is the set of neighbour capital where is the set of nearest neighbours so for all neighbours similarity UV similarity UV is as we computed in the previous face X RBI - are we were so for a user we who is similar to user you will look at the difference of the rating of V for a minus the average rating of the user so if the rating of item I for user V is greater than the average rating of that user this is positive otherwise it is better tips and the way,36_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
37,particular neighbour is given away based on how similar is she is to the user you so suppose we have a user you who is our target user and I is our target item so we find the neighbours letter se V1 V2 V3 and they are the most similar uses and with each of them we have a value suppose we are one we have a value point 6 supposedly to have a 12.3 and V3 BA value point to 5 then we look at the prediction of the user V1 for item and the weights that by point 6 by the similarity of V1 with you will look at the rating of V2 for item weighted by point 3 look at the rating of V3 for item which 5.25 and to overcome the ace tractor because different users have different standards of rating everything we are doing in terms of the average as we see in this light is a look at the slide again so we have the UI equal to are you bar average rating of user you times for all neighbours same UV for all members we seem UV X RBI - 8 and in the denominator we have for all there is neighbours the US in summation of the,37_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
38,so based on this we do our recommendation know the similarity computer can be positive and negative we took the look at the absolute value of the similarity in audit,38_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
39,this collaborative filtering based recommendation system for collaborative filtering this is collaborative filtering based recommendation system using k-nearest neighbour or user based kenya's,39_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
40,ok the problem of user based formulation of collaborative filtering is the lack of scalability if you have many users in a popular sites like Amazon or Netflix they can have many users billion users now it is not possible in real time to find out the most similar users because as we have seen instance based learning outcomes of these types of learning outcomes are lazy at runtime you find the most similar users and if the total number it is a very large it is a difficult without the use of good data structures to find the most similar users in runtime and while several data structures clustering at 17 can be used to make this board efficient and alternative to user based nearest neighbour is item-based nearest neighbour for item based collaborative filtering,40_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
41,in item based collaborative filtering what we do is that we find similarity between the items we compare the items,41_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
42,so if you have two items I and the similarity between these two items are computed as the formula is very similar to what we use for user based collaborative filtering here with some over all users,42_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
43,are you I - are you,43_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
44,,44_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
45,science are you a - are you so that the rating of user you for item times the rating of user you for items returned with some track the mean for that user and in the denominator we have,45_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
46,Root over Sigma,46_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
47,over all users,47_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
48,are you I - are you bar holes,48_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
49,x,49_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
50,Sigma over all user,50_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
51,Mujhe - are you bar,51_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
52,so based on this we find the similarity between the items now once we find the similarity of the items in the neighborhood formation face then we go to the recommendation face in the recommendation phase we select a set of K most similar items to the target item so we have a target item,52_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
53,and for the target item we find the most similar writing so target I can,53_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
54,we find that came on,54_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
55,I want I to i k based on this formula that we have written right and then we do the rating prediction the rating prediction is done PU,55_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
56,,56_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
57,Sigma I can the summation over the similar items capital Jaya the case similar items with you are you Jay times the similarity of item ID,57_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
58,/ Sigma,58_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
59,Jay again over all neighbouring items,59_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
60,based on this the rating is predicted,60_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
61,item based collaborative filtering so with this brief introduction we come to the end of a recommendation systems which is an application of KD as neighbours and we also come to an end of this body after this serve the next module that we will start is on probabilities bayesian learning nice base and you such things of course will also have one class by our teaching in assistant on how to use this nearest neighbour in an instance based learning type of algorithms in summer vacation time,61_Lecture_15__Collaborative_Filtering.wav
